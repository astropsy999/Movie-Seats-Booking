# Movie Seat Booking UI

A simple frontend interface for selecting seats for a movie screening, built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## Features

*   Select a movie from a dropdown menu.
*   View a seat map with available, selected, and occupied seats.
*   Click on available seats to select or deselect them.
*   See a running total of the number of selected seats and the total price.
*   Selected movie and seats are saved to the browser's local storage, so selections persist even after closing the browser tab.

## Technologies Used

*   HTML
*   CSS
*   JavaScript (Vanilla)

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

*   DOM Manipulation (selecting elements, adding/removing classes, updating text content)
*   Event Handling (listening for clicks on seats and changes in the movie selection dropdown)
*   Using `localStorage` to persist data locally in the browser.
*   Basic CSS styling for layout and visual states.

## How to Run

1.  Ensure you have the `index.html`, `style.css`, and `scripts.js` files in the same directory.
2.  Open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser.
